Hi {{$member->first}},\r\n\r\n

I want to thank you for supporting HackRVA.  Your payment method on Quickbooks has expired, so I'm asking you to renew your membership payment via Paypal at https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=DVRHULKYBCY4A.\r\n\r\n

In addition to keeping the space open, your support helps HackRVA maintain equipment, purchase new tools, and build our community. Recent updates include new 3D printers, room swap, and a Thunder Laser 100 watt laser is on the way.  We're also in negotiations to expand our space into an adjacent building to increase our total space to 4,000 square feet!\r\n\r\n

While standard membership dues are changing to $35/month on 4/19/2018, the link in this message will renew your membership with your existing $30 rate.\r\n\r\n

I'm looking forward to your continued support and especially excited about our opportunity to vastly expand our space in the coming months.\r\n\r\n

Renew via PayPal at the following link.\r\n

Thanks, \r\n
