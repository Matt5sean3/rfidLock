<p>Hi {{$member->first}},</p>

<p>I want to thank you for supporting HackRVA.  Your payment method on Quickbooks has expired, so I'm asking you to renew your membership payment via Paypal at <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=7C97RJ2TULVL4">https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=7C97RJ2TULVL4</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to keeping the space open, your support helps HackRVA maintain equipment, purchase new tools, and build our community. Recent updates include new 3D printers, the room swap and renovations, and a Thunder Laser 100 watt laser (arriving soon!).  We're also in negotiations to expand our space into an adjacent building to increase our total space to 4,000 square feet!</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to your continued support and especially excited about our opportunity to vastly expand our space in the coming months.</p>
